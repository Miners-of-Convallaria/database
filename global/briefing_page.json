Many Irians see the Sword of Convallaria as traitors who would even slay their own countrymen.\nAlthough the Papal States didn't openly accuse the Sword of Convallaria, they begin keeping their distance. Their agreement to lend humanitarian aid also becomes void. Relations between the two worsens as the Papal States keeps its guard up and observes the mercenary group's actions with indifference.

Although we are in different camps and have different beliefs, I still believe that you are an honest and kind person.\nI have always believed that only spreading Light of Sanctuary to every corner of the world can bring peace to the world, but it seems that... things are not what I thought.\nAnyway, I learned a lot from you during my time with you.\nNow I have to do one thing, to stop... Papal States's plan to save hundreds of Irian.\nIt sounds ridiculous. It seems that yesterday, the believers of Light of Sanctuary were defenders of peace, and today they have become schemers who will do whatever it takes for ambition...\nBut at least one thing I can be sure of is that I have to stop them, and only this is absolutely correct.\nAnyway, thanks to Light of Sanctuary, we met.\nMay Light of Sanctuary bless you forever.\n\n<align=\"right\">Samantha·Ambrogio·Perrin",

As you already know, for a long time, Iria was but another vassal state of Rodinia. To them, this land is nothing but a source of Luxite. The nobles who ran the old state forced its people into labor camps to toil day in and day out, all to line their own pockets. The shine of Luxite has been shrouded in my people's blood. \nThe Papal States called themselves rulers, but they enforced no laws so long as they received their tithes. These cruelties are what led the people to rebel in the first place and is why they crowned General Faris king of the new nation. This is the blood-soaked history of the country where I was born. \nWhatever differences need to be bridged between the two nations aren't going to be resolved by a mere peace treaty. I doubt this information will make things any easier for you but, as a friend, it is my duty to be honest with you, just as I must always be honest in my historical research. \nRegardless of what you choose, I will support you and wish you the blessing of Radiant on your trip.
