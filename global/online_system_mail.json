    "content": "Dear Leader of S.O.C.,\nIn response to your request for refund, we have deducted a corresponding amount of Astral Gem/Blessing of Hope from your account. \nIf the available Astral Gem in your account is not enough to cover the requested refund at the time of deduction, the items will still be correspondingly deducted so that the resulting amount is under zero. You can purchase Astral Gem to make up for the shortfall. \nShould dishonest refund requests be detected, your account may be banned after a certain amount of deduction. \n\nIt takes our mutual effort to maintain a fair and orderly gaming environment. We thank you for your support and cooperation. If you have any questions regarding our decision, feel free to contact customer service in the game."
