    "text": "The situation is deteriorating to a suffocating degree. The Papal States have been suppressing civilian riots in both Waverun City and the Mine Pit. Countless civilians have been killed in front of our eyes, but there is little that we can do to stop it.\nOur hands were even forced to protect Fernando… a heinous beast. In the end, Edda broke cooperation with us, and our friend Taair was implicated and killed… \nSamantha is in pain and feels helpless; I've done all I can to comfort her. I sometimes dare to wonder, if we had made different choices, would our results also have differed? But such musings are nothing more than fantasies.\nLooking back, the road we walk is covered in mud and bloodshed. Too many have wailed and cursed our names, and many important people have left us…\nSamantha and I know that our hands are stained with sin. But… this is a decision we made together. For the sake of peace in Iria and for those who have left us, instead of indulging in regret, we must do more to remedy the situation…",

    "text": "With every decision, it feels as if we are walking on the edge of a cliff, and a single misstep would have us careening into the depths of the valley. However, I believe Samantha has finally made the right choice. This time, we stood firmly behind those who resisted the Papal States. We executed the heinous Fernando, rescued the children who were to be sent to the Grand Sanctuary, and witnessed the true face of the Papal States.\nWith each of these critical decisions, Samantha has gradually broken away from her self-inflicted shackles. Her eyes no longer carry confusion, worry and pain—they now shine with determination. The path to the light should not be built by sacrifice. It should be pure and bright, advocating for kindness and caring for the world. I have known Samantha for a long time. I believe that this is the path she should take, and the one that rings true in her heart. \nOf course, the path that heralds new hope is blocked by a hundred mountains. We don't have the strength to face an entity such as the Papal States… but we will never give up. Despite the circumstances, we have a firm plan and steadfast allies. Our plan has not been carefully considered—it may even seem desperate. But I have faith in everyone involved: Taair, Edda, and Inanna. \nIn the end, all I can do is pray to Radiant that all we've planned goes well.",

    "text": "We failed to gather enough supporters from the Mine Pit…\nLooking back, there were key moments that perhaps we could've handled better. When Dantalion attempted to cut off the Mine Pit's food supply, when we helped fight against the Order, and when we dealt with the ransoms for the Vlderians... Perhaps we could have done more. \nWhat's done is done. As it stands, the situation is irreparable. We must continue with the allies that we have.",

    "text": "It's been a few months since I woke up in that dungeon and settled in the Town of Convallaria.\nRawiyah entrusted me with the Sword of Convallaria Mercenary Group, and I somehow became the Trade Master of the Convallaria Trading Post.\nSince it's all for the benefit of the Town of Convallaria, it's not a problem.\nDuring this time, the girl we saved in Waverun City joined us. She revealed to me that she is the princess of Iria—which was surprising, but upon reflection made sense.\nWhen dealing with the Vlderian Dance Troupe case, I accidentally pushed SchackLulu further than I expected. Thinking of it, I owe her an apology.\nThe most fulfilling thing throughout this time was helping Edda and others renovate the abandoned Mine Pit, accommodating more refugees.\nThe Mine Pit is large enough, but the land is barren, and their supply of food relies heavily on the outside world. Perhaps when they have their own core industry and conduct reasonable exchanges with the outside world, the people of the Mine Pit can truly have a new home.\nTo make up for losses caused by the Darklight, I must go to the Rabi'a Oasis.\nAlthough it's a strange and distant place, I'm full of anticipation for what might happen there.",

    "text": "I didn't expect the goods I delivered to the Rabi'a Oasis to be slaves.\nI wouldn't want to be tied up and stuffed into a holding cell either, so I chose to help them escape.\nAlthough it had some subsequent consequences, not all of them were bad. In any case, I don't regret this decision.\nThe Rabi'a Oasis is indeed a novel place, and I feel like I can never finish exploring it. However, according to what Acambe once said, the Grand Bazaar in Hashalaram is much bigger than the market there, which is hard to imagine.\nAfter overcoming some challenges, I finally met Acambe again. What baffles me is that he easily solved the Darklight crisis with money. What kind of organization is the Darklight? How powerful can coin be?\nAfter dealing with both the Advance Order and the King's Army, I found that they treated the Trading Post and our Mercenary Group differently. The consensus seems to be that neither side cares about where you stand.\nWe continue to get new partners, and a new friend with interesting ears is changing the oppressive atmosphere of the long-running war.\nI thought that holding a grand Convallaria Festival and bringing everyone together would be a great idea.\nBut it proved to be a very naive notion.",

    "text": "Thanks to Homa finding crucial evidence, the Town of Convallaria has been cleared of suspicion.\nI once had a great impression of Lutfi, but his decision to sacrifice us to save himself greatly disappointed me.\nDuring this time, Acambe and I went our separate ways due to disagreements over weapon trading. We've been trading separately for now. \nBut I am certain that no peace can be achieved by supplying large numbers of weapons to both sides of a war.\nI've been consistently sending aid to Edda and NonoWill. Together, they've finally managed to establish a powerful new organization.\nI believe this is an effective path to peace.",

    "text": "Finally, the Advance Order and the King's Army agreed to a truce. It seems our efforts have brought about substantial changes.\nBut this also dealt severe damage to Acambe's weapons trade. Just as I started to worry about him, I fell into a trap he had set in the past. Is such a mutually destructive situation really unavoidable?\nHoma selflessly stepped forward at that moment, actively taking the blame for me, for which I feel very guilty. Moreover, she was the first to notify me when she heard about Acambe's misfortune, even though she and Acambe don't seem to get along.\nWhen we rescued Acambe, we unexpectedly learned that beyond the arms trade, there were past grievances between him and Cocoa's parents.\nTheir story made me realize the complexity of human relationships. I don't know how Acambe will face Cocoa in the future.\nBut all these grudges have been diluted by the neutral status of the Crossroads Keep—thanks to Inanna's wise and brave effort. \nMany Irians are currently engrossed in the joy of an impending peace. But before that can happen, there are a few final difficulties to face. ",
